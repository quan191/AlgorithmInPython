# AlgorithmInPython
In this project i will try to implement data structure and algorithms in python 3 . 

## Authors
The one and only **Lê Ngọc Anh Quân** - [Link github](https://github.com/quan191)

## Roadmap
* I think i will start with CSES problem set 
* Then i think geekforgeeks is the best site for learning data structure and algorithms 


## Target 
* Master data structure and algorithms
* Become an international grandmaster ( red rank ) in Code Force 
* Use algorithms and data structure in other project
